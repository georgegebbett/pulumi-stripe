/// With this resource, you can create a product - [Stripe API product documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/products).
/// 
/// Products describe the specific goods or services you offer to your customers. For example,
/// you might offer a Standard and Premium version of your goods or service; each version would be a separate Product.
/// 
/// &gt; Deleting a product is only possible if it has no prices associated with it.
/// 
/// ## Example Usage
/// 
/// ```csharp
/// using System.Collections.Generic;
/// using System.Linq;
/// using Pulumi;
/// using Stripe = Pulumi.Stripe;
/// 
/// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
/// {
///     // The product with more fields filled
///     var product = new Stripe.Product("product", new()
///     {
