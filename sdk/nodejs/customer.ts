/**
 * With this resource, you can create a customer - [Stripe API customer documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers).
 *
 * Customer objects allow you to perform recurring charges, and to track multiple charges,
 * that are associated with the same customer.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as stripe from "pulumi-stripe";
 *
 * // A customer with other details
 * const customer = new stripe.Customer("customer", {
 *     balance: 10000,
 *     invoicePrefix: "LA000",
 *     invoiceSettings: {
 *         customFieldName: "customFieldValue",
 *         footer: "--- Lukas Aron ---",
 *     },
 *     nextInvoiceSequence: 1001,
 *     preferredLocales: [
 *         "eng",
 *         "esp",
 *     ],
 *     shipping: {
 *         city: "Sydney",
 *         country: "AU",
 *         line1: "1 The Best Street",
 *         line2: "Apartment 401",
 *         name: "Lukas Aron",
 *         phone: "+610123456789",
 *         postal_code: "2000",
 *         state: "New South Wales",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
